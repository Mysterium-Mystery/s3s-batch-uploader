# s3s-batch-uploader
Simple C# program to upload your locally saved s3s data automatically

### Usage
1. Download the entire folder
2. Put all of your locally stored s3s data (All the folders named like "export-*some big number*") in one folder that has only these folders in it
3. Run S3HiStory.exe
4. Enter the path of your "Data Folder" (The one where you just put all the "export-*some big number* folders into")
5. Enter the path of your "S3S (mod) Folder" (The folder which contains your s3s.py file)
6. It should do everything automatically but make sure to look at the console output. If you use my modded version of s3s.py (https://github.com/Mysterium-Mystery/s3s-sr-language-fix) some input of you might still sometimes be required. Any errors in the console are most likely caused by s3s and not by this batch uploader, but if you think there's an issue, feel free to contact me

Little Disclaimer: Since this is written in C# you probably need to have some .NET Framework or similar things installed
